    IBAN: CZ0920100000002001303248
    BIC/SWIFT: FIOBCZPPXXX

IMPORTANT: Please include your e-mail address in the payment order.

In case you run into any trouble, feel free to contact me. (Just pay
attention not to post to the whole mailing-list, unless that is what
you want. We are trying to keep this as low-traffic as possible.)
